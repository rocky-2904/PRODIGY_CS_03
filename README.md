# PASSWORD COMPLEXITY CHECKER
A password complexity checker evaluates the strength of a password based on specific criteria to ensure it meets security standards.
Here's an overview of what a typical password complexity checker evaluates
# Key Criteria for Password Complexity:
# LENGTH
  A longer password is generally more secure. A common minimum length requirement is 8 characters, but longer passwords (12-16 characters) are even more secure
# CHARACTER VARIETY
  Lowercase Letters: At least one lowercase letter (a-z).
  Uppercase Letters: At least one uppercase letter (A-Z).Digits: At least one numeric digit (0-9).
  Special Characters: At least one special character (e.g., @, #, $, %, ^, &, +, =)
# NON REPETATIVE CHARACTER
  Avoid using repetitive characters (e.g., "aaaaaa") or sequential characters (e.g., "12345", "abcdef").
# AVOID COMMON PASSWORD
  Common passwords (e.g., "password", "123456", "qwerty") are easily guessable and should be avoided
# AVOID PERSONAL INFORMATION
  Avoid using easily obtainable personal information like birthdays, names, or common phrases
